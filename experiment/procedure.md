<p>To start the experiment user have to open the simulator and then select the desired signal to be generated from the drop-down menu. Once the user select the signal then a corresponding MATLAB code will open in command window.<br> After that user have to press the start button provided at the bottom of code window and then click on to the next for line-by-line execution of code.<br> Based on the selected signal, user may have to enter the various parameter in command window for which a slider will be opened. The slider will have a pre-defined range for the particular parameter to be entered.<br> After selecting a particular value on the slider, click on ok button. As the codes executes line-by-line the user can see the variables created in the Workspace window.<br>  Finally, after execution of entire code, time-domain waveform of selected signal will be plotted in the Plot window. User either reset the program to execute the same code for different value of parameters or select the different signal from drop-down menu to generate different signals.  </p>
